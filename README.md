(TreatmentJournal.net - not live)

On the same night that I graduated from AppAcademy, a fullstack web development bootcamp, I received a call informing me that I have lymphoma. As I spent the next 24 hours searching for information, trying to wrangle doctors, appointments, and treatment options, I quickly realized that I needed to come up with a good system to organize all of these aspects of my upcoming battle.

Also seeking a project to continue my growth as a programmer and software developer, I thought it might be a fun (and helpful) problem to tackle this organization challenge with my new skills. I spent a little time researching online and saw that patient self-monitoring is said to be beneficial to anyone fighting an illness, and potentially beneficial to medical providers as well.

So what problems am I trying to solve?

- Telling people that I'm sick (I'm already tired of having the same conversation on the phone)
- Keeping everyone up to date with changes and the latest details
- Keeping track of my symptoms, weight (daily log)
- Keeping track of all the different doctors and locations (sync with calendar and google maps?)
- Sharing things my partner and I need or that people can do for us
- Track treatments over time
- Upload recordings of doctors meetings, call log (who, when, what was discussed)
- What medications/doses were taken each day
- Option to share treatment/symptom data with researchers?
